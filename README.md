# Nanomagmetic Monte Carlo Driver

This is developed for micromagnetics model for monte carlo simulations. This was developed as an extension of Ubermag, a micromagnetic simulations package. Ubermag ![Ubermag](https://ubermag.github.io/index.html) is a collection of several independent Python packages that can be used independently as well as in combination. Ubermag has several energy minimisation drivers but this package allows simulation to be done using non-perturbative approach.
