# Nanomagmetic Monte Carlo Simulation

This is micromagnetics model for monte carlo simulations in nanomagnetism. This was developed to be used with Ubermag. Ubermag is a collection of several independent Python packages that can be used independently as well as in combination. The whole set of packages – the ubermag meta-package – is tailored to micromagnetic simulations. The individual sub-packages can be used in other fields, e.g. fluid dynamics.
The Ubermag has several energy minimisation drivers but this package allows for simulation to be done in non-perturbative manner.
