McPy Documentation
================================

Introduction:
-------------

McPy is a package developed for monte carlo simulations in micromagnetics to study magnetic pseudoparticles. The primary aim is to study the thermal stability of bloch points to access their feasibility for information storage.
This has been developed as part of my Master's thesis "Monte Carlo Simulations: Probing the Thermal Stability of Bloch Points" to develop a monte carlo driver to be used as an extension of [Ubermag](https://ubermag.github.io/index.html), a micromagnetic simulations package. Ubermag is a collection of several independent Python packages that can be used independently as well as in combination to be used for other physics simulations such as Fluid Dynamics.


#### Why Monte Carlo in micromagnetics?

Here are several papers validating the effectiveness of monte carlo in this field
 - [Simulating anti-skyrmions on a lattice](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-22043-0)
 - [The skyrmion lattice phase in three dimensional chiral magnets from Monte Carlo simulations](https://arxiv.org/abs/1304.6580)
 - [Monte Carlo simulations of skyrmion lattice in chiral magnets](https://arxiv.org/abs/1304.6580)
